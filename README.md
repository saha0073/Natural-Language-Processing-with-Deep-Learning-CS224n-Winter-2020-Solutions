### [Assignment 2](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a2.pdf). Word2Vec from Scratch (Done)

### [Assignment 3](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a3.pdf). Neural Dependency Parsing (Done)

### [Assignment 4](http://web.stanford.edu/class/cs224n/assignments/a4.pdf). Neural Machine Translation with RNNs (Done)

### [Assignment 5](https://github.com/saha0073/Natural-Language-Processing-with-Deep-Learning-CS224n-Winter-2020-Solutions/blob/master/a5/a5.pdf). Character-based convolutional encoder for NMT & Character-based LSTM decoder for NMT (Done)

Happy learning!
